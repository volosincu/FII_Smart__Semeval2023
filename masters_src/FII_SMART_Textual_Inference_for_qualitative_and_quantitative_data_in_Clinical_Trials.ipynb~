            "     - Outcome Measurement:    Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve to Compare Diagnostic Accuracy of 2 Algorithms in Breast Cancer Diagnosis   The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Siemens' processing algorithm to Lorad's processing algorithm with regards to readers' diagnostic accuracy in detecting and characterizing breast lesions. The non-inferiority analyses were performed by comparing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the two algorithms & to compare false positive marks per subject. \n",
            "     -   The ROC curve incorporates both sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) providing a single assessment incorporating both measures. It shows in a graphical way the trade-off between clinical sensitivity and specificity for every possible cut-off for a test, and gives an idea about the benefit of using the test in question. The higher the total area under the curve, the greater the predictive power of the reader assessments.  A breast-based analysis was used for the primary AUC comparison in order to obtain additional power by having more normal/benign breasts. \n",

The mean of the 13 items in the fatigue subscale (range from 0-10) and the mean of the 5 items in the energy subscale (range from 0-10) are calculated. Higher scores indicate higher levels of perceived fatigue and energy . Items in the energy subscale were recoded, and a Lee fatigue total score was calculated as the average of all 18 items (ranging between 0 and 10), higher scores indicating higher levels of fatigue.\n",
